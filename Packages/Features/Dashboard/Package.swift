//
// Same shape as every feature package: four dependencies, no `Persistence`, one level deeper than
// the rest of Packages/. All of that is argued once, in
// Packages/Features/ExerciseLibrary/Package.swift.
// G-3.4 (T-1.14) adds two lines and a fifth dependency to the shape above. `defaultLocalization`
// plus `resources:` give the module its own catalogue at Sources/<Target>/Resources/en.lproj/, so
// its copy resolves against `Bundle.module` rather than the app's; `Localization` carries the key
// convention and the locale-explicit format styles. Read Localization's module doc before adding a
// string — a `.xcstrings` here is inert under `swift build`, which is the whole reason for the
// `.strings` form.
